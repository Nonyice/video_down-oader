Custom File Naming: Automatically generate unique file names for each download.
Interactive UI: A modern, animated header with captivating effects to engage users.
Ease of Use: Simple input form to process video URLs with minimal effort.
Lightweight Setup: No need for external tools like FFmpeg; everything is managed by yt-dlp.
Technologies Used
Backend: Flask (Python)
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (with animations), JavaScript
Video/Audio Processing: yt-dlp
Styling: Google Fonts, CSS animations
Particle Effects: Custom particle overlay for aesthetic enhancement
